# Problem statement
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10001st prime number?

# Solution
Continue generating numbers and checking if they are prime until reaching the required prime

## Alternate solution
Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate primes below a certain number, and using the tables for the [Prime counting function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function) we can see that generating the primes below 10<sup>6</sup> will be sufficent
