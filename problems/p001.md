# Problem statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Solution
Loop over all the number in the range and sum only the ones that are multiple of 3 and 5

## Alternate solution
The requested sum is equal to the sum of the multiplies of 3 plus the sum of the multiplies of 5 minus the sum of the multiples of 15. All of this sums can be calculated from the formula for the sum of a mathematical progression
