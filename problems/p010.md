# Problem statement
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

# Solution (previously the alternate solution)
Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate primes below the limit and calculate their sum

## Alternate solution (previously the original solution, which truned out to be slow)
Loop over numbers below the limit and check if they are prime and keep track of their sum
