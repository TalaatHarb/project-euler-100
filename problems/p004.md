# Problem statement
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Solution
Loop over all 3 digit numbers and find if the product with another 3 digit number is palindromic, while keeping track of the greatest palindromic number obtained
