# Problem statement
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

# Solution
Generate the triangular numbers one after the other and then calculate the number of their divisors until you reach the target, optimizing the calculation of the number of divisors using a pre-calculation of the primes (using a sieve method) is kinda of mandatory to get the solution in less than one minute

# Optimization
Using the fact that the number of divisors of a triangular number can be reduced to the calculation of the number of divisors of two smaller coprime numbers(n and (n+1)/2 if n is odd or n/2 and (n+1) if n is even), this can speed the process up dramatically
