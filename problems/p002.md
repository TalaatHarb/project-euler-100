# Problem statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Solution
Generating the numbers in the fibonaci sequence one after the other and adding them to the sum if they are even until we reach a number in the sequence over 4,000,000
